      "--> these people are amazingly friendly, helpful and have high integrity. i feel very happy to have found them when i moved back to phoenix and need someone to care for my car.\n",
      "--> i love southview, and i don't think i'd ever say i love a dentists' office.  every member of the staff is extremely friendly and courteous. no matter what time of day i am there everyone is (or pretends to be) in the best mood ever. very professional, very clean and modern, even relaxing!  everyone was upfront with pricing, they wanted to make me feel as comfortable as possible (massage options in the chair? tvs above you? headphones for the tv? yes please!), and even though i know they're churning through patients, i never feel rushed out the door if i have questions or concerns.   after my initial consultation there i've had my teeth cleaned, old fillings repaired, and even some new cavities filled. they use a three-part numbing process so i've never had issues with pain.   my only complaint is sometimes, especially towards the end of the year, appointments are hard to book - but that's kind of how it goes most places.   definitely recommend them!\n",
      "--> used eat24 take out. great pizza. wings are good.  we'll worth it. i will be using them over the hut in the future\n",
      "--> i did not stay at this hotel but i did visit the hotel and the shops. beautiful place!!!! not too crowded, very quiet and peaceful... i love this place. this hotel is located on the strip on the north end.. it's less crowded on the north and there is a mall right across the street. this hotel has many high end stores for shopping such as lv, cartier, etc, but there is a regular mall across the street with macy's, forever 21, etc..  the gondola rides are nice, but short!! it's 19.95 a person and it's 10mins long. they can stay in doors and out doors with the gondola. i heard out door is better at night because of the lights. great overall experience, wonderful restaurants, awesome shops..\n",

      "Few instances where it predicted negative but it should be positive: \n",

      "--> i love it! almost all options are available in a vegan version. yum! i am moving, and am so sad i will not longer be able to come here. so i made one last trip today. i hope they consider expanding so i can enjoy the yummy items here once again.\n",
